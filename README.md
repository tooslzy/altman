## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (Tested for Windows 11 24H2)
- Active internet connection

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools) with the **Desktop development with C++** workload
- CMake ‚â• 3.25
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) (any location; set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bat
git clone https://github.com/crowsyndrome/AltMan.git
cd AltMan
```

### 2. Bootstrap vcpkg (if you do not already have it)

```bat
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git %USERPROFILE%\vcpkg
%USERPROFILE%\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

### 3. Install dependencies

The project ships with a `vcpkg.json` manifest. With vcpkg on your `%PATH%` simply run:

```bat
vcpkg install
```

(If you skip this step vcpkg will build the ports automatically the first time CMake configures.)

### 4. Build with plain CMake (command-line)

```bat
mkdir build
cmake -B build -S . ^
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake ^
  -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The executable will be generated at `build\altman\altman.exe` together with the required `assets` folder.

### 5. (Optional) Build from CLion

1. Open the project folder in CLion.
2. Go to **File ‚ñ∏ Settings ‚ñ∏ Build, Execution, Deployment ‚ñ∏ CMake** and add  
   `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` to _CMake options_.
3. Make sure the **Toolchain** is set to the _Visual Studio_ toolchain (x86_64).
4. Press ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to run the `altman` target.
